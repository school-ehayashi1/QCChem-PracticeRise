# My Experience With Rise January 17 2024

The project with Rise was a harrowing and stressing experience - partly in part due to my selection of topic with a desire to challenge myself. 
Although this was the case, the experience greatly impacted me as I had realized many parts of myself that I would not have realized without the added stress that I put myself under.
